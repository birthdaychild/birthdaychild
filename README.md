## ***HOW TO INT***

**“I prefer if you walk up to me and try sharing interest, mostly I don't allow the "Hi, can we be friends?" anymore, sorry but it isn't my problem. If we know eachother and you want to talk I prefer you walk up to me, because I am NOT going to walk up to you and talk to you, unless you tell me to walk up to you, I will do.”** 

## ***DNI LIST***

**“ON @dirtytears, but I'll put more, people who are obtrusive, like bother random conversations they're not invited in, this makes me mad sometimes.”**

## ***THINGS TO NOT TALK AROUND ME***

**“Bad things about me, past me, my past life, my exes, WARS, or my country war, the earthquake, disgusting things, inappropriate things and don't act annoying that's it. Try to give other respect.”**

## ***PERSONALITY***

**“I heard people talk about my personality a lot, I just wanna say I'm direct and honest with what I say, if you can't handle that, feel free to block or anything. So I'm not really that sensitive. And I am NOT going to change my personality and be the person everybody wants me to be, I'm going to be myself and love myself.”**

## ***WARNING***

**“If ur in my blocklist, there might be reasons, You blocked me first, You're problematic or I feel uncomfortable around you, or you made my fof/fam uncomfortable.”**

## ***STATUS***
