## ***HOW TO INT***

**“I prefer if you walk up to me and try sharing interest, mostly I don't allow the "Hi, can we be friends?" anymore, sorry but it isn't my problem. If we know eachother and you want to talk I prefer you walk up to me, because I am NOT going to walk up to you and talk to you, unless you tell me to walk up to you, I will do.” (i dont bite!)** 

## ***DNI LIST***

**“ON @dirtytears, but I'll put more, people who are obtrusive, like bother random conversations they're not invited in, this makes me mad sometimes. Enemies, you can gossip all the time I don't care and you're just wasting your time talking about me because I bet more people like to hear about me more than you so fck off enemies. Overdramatic people <-- I'm not overdramatic if I'm mature, y'all js mistaking for no reason, and when I mean by Overdramatic people i mean by people who interpret a delayed text message as a sign the relationship is ending. (REALLY) Immature people, yes I don't have to explain, block me please I beg you, Don't come into my life, Oversensitive people <-- idrc about u venting to me if ur rlly sad, but don't use me for no reason only for venting, I'm not ur personal therapist and if you want me to be, That's gonna cost money.”**

## ***THINGS TO NOT TALK AROUND ME***

**“Bad things about me, past me, my past life, my exes, WARS, or my country war, the earthquake, disgusting things, inappropriate things and don't act annoying that's it. Try to give other respect.”**

## ***PERSONALITY***

**“I heard people talk about my personality a lot, I just wanna say I'm direct and honest with what I say, if you can't handle that, feel free to block or anything. So I'm not really that sensitive. And I am NOT going to change my personality and be the person everybody wants me to be, I'm going to be myself and love myself. Because why would I be the sad, depressed, insecure clingy friend? Never. Another thing, some people said they're scared of me (pretty much a lot) Do not fear me, stop saying ur fucking scared of me, fear Lord, The one and only our king, if ur still scared of me, Go on, be scared. Because I can't do anything about it anyway, it's your own issue not my issue./not yapping shit here, some people say this.”**

## ***WARNING***

**“If ur in my blocklist, there might be reasons, You blocked me first, You're problematic or I feel uncomfortable around you, or you made my fof/fam uncomfortable.”**

## ***STATUS***

**Online: “Mostly, I don't use status but I will from now on, as I say, I'm able to talk 50/50, I may be semi afk, who knows, God does.”**

**Idle: “Afk and I will NOT read ur messages.”**

**Do not Disturb: “Busy, probably doing job or doing something irl.”**

**Looking for Chat: “I really need someone to talk to me!”**

**Looking for Roleplay: “no.”**

**Offline: “hiding or offline.”**

# ***SLAGS***

**C+H✅: “Cuddle+Hug, This is** ***VERY*** **rare, so mostly I might need someone to c+h me badly,(strangers can too) it only happens when I'm feeling** ***VERY*** **upset or clingy. [allthough this will never happen.]”**

**Int: “Interact, I want someone to interact with me.”**

**W2I: “Whisper to Interact, mostly this is for strangers, but friends/fam can do too.”**

**Dni: “Do not Interact, well you can tell I'm really pïssed off. And I mean it. So I might be aggressive a little if you interact.”**

**Dnt: “Do not touch, I'm never on this.”**

**Iwc: “Interact with Caution: Not in a good mood (a bit).”**

**Iwec: “Interact with Extreme Caution, I'm not feeling in a good mood at all, mostly very mad, I won't lunge at you for interacting dw. Just be careful with what you say.”**

**Upset: “This is also** ***VERY*** **rare, I'm mostly not sensitive, so something must have clenches my heart realy badly.”**
